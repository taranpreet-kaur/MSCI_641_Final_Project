# MSCI_641_Final_Project
In most online recommender systems the user ratings are analyzed by the model to learn user behavior and recommend the items to such users based on their rating patterns. However, issue with this approach is that different users have a different pattern of rating items. There could be users who would give an average rating to an item but would highly recommend that item to their peers. Such variations in the rating system do not capture user-item relationship and behavior in an optimal way. What could be beneficial are the user reviews and analyzing the sentiments of the users towards the items. In our project we devised a model that learns the item properties and user reviews in parallel deep models, and based on the coupled results computed by each models we would predict whether an item should be recommended to the user.
This project is in collabration of two students at University of Waterloo for their Final Project Submission.
